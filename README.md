Hi, I hope you are well. :)

Anyway to run app first install node_package (npm install), after that run project (ng serve).

Just in case to know:

Project has search function, on sighting card clicking on (by 'some user') will send you to user page and 'add new sighting' buttons in sighting list are not working (there is good explanation for that), to create new sighting, got to flower detail by (clicking on flower card) and after that 'add new sighting' button will work.

That's it, I hope its good and see you... maybe.
